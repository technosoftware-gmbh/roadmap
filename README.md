# Technosoftware OPC Solutions Roadmap

:sparkle: View the [OPC Solution Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/technosoftware-gmbh/projects/16)

Our solution roadmap shows you what features and issues we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases. 

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the solution to which the item belongs. For a list of current solution areas, see below.

- A **feature** that indicates the feature or solution to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 

- One or more **solution SKU** labels that indicate which solution SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current solution SKUs, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **delivered** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the solution or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **testing:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability, features and fixes for issues still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation or support provided.

- **support:** *Available only for customers with support subscription*\
Features and fixes for issues mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for general availability usually published. Only available for customers with a support subscription.

- **source:** *Available to all customers as source*\
Features and fixes for issues ready for production use and available to all customers using the source of the soultions.

- **all:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Features and fixes for issues ready for production use and available to all customers as source and local nuget packages.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every feature or issue is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to delivered next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.

Once we know what version we are delivering a feature or fix of an issue, we will update the issue to indicate that information.
